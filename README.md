# Visual Loss

Helps visualize a loss function. Written with the help of ChatGPT. No libraries used.

# To run

Go to https://arisweedler.github.io/visual-loss/

## To change the data

Change the `generatePoints` function

## To change the model

Change the `point_on_line` function. Maybe you'll wanna call it `point_on_quadratic` instead.

## To change the loss function

Change the `handle_distance` function.

Most likely you only wanna change the lambda, and not the reduction.
